# React Styled Components Course V5
This repo contains all of the code written alongside the "React Styled Components Course (V5)" that I am following along with to hopefully become better at styling my React applications. The tutorial exists here if you would like to purchase it and follow along: https://www.udemy.com/course/styled-components-tutorial-and-project-course

Styled Components Documentation exists here: https://styled-components.com/

I think this course is a great way to get started with styled components but ultimately is more useful if you already have deep CSS / styling background.
